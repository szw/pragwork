Pragwork is a pragmatic web framework for PHP 5.3+ inspired by the ideas of Ruby on Rails. The framework supports MVC and RESTful approaches and uses the PHP ActiveRecord library for O/R mapping. Pragwork has also the internal support for localization, AJAX, Textile, Markdown, PHP Mailer, and more. And all of that is slightly mixed with a rationale philosophy utilizing the best sides of PHP along with the common sense of making software.

Pragwork is the technology created by Szymon Wrozynski â€” a freelance software developer from Poland. Currently, Pragwork is free, open source software in continuous development, publicly available under the MIT license. Pragwork requires a web server (PHP 5.3, URL rewriting) and a database server. The console generator you have used (prag) requires a Python interpreter.

I hope you do enjoy pragworking!

Good luck with your projects!
