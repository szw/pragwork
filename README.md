**Pragwork** is a pragmatic web framework for PHP 5.3+ inspired by 
the ideas of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). The framework supports 
[MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) and 
[RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RESTful) approaches and uses the [PHP ActiveRecord](http://www.phpactiverecord.org) library for 
[O/R mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). Pragwork has also the internal support for localization, [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX), [Textile](http://textile.thresholdstate.com), [Markdown](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown), [PHP Mailer](http://phpmailer.worxware.com), and more. And all of that is slightly mixed with a rationale philosophy utilizing the best sides of PHP along with the common sense of making software.

Pragwork is the technology created by [Szymon Wrozynski](http://pragwork.com/en/about-author-and-contributors#szymon) &mdash; a freelance software developer from Poland. Currently, Pragwork is free, open source software in continuous development, publicly available under the 
[MIT License](http://pragwork.com/en/license). Pragwork requires a web server (PHP 5.3, URL rewriting) and a database server. The console generator you have used (**Prag**) requires a Python interpreter.

I hope you do enjoy pragworking!

Good luck with your projects!
