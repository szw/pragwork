== GNU/LINUX INSTALLATION ==

To install on Linux is very simple, just follow these 2 steps:
- After you clone the repository, create a symbolic link to the prag script on the 
  /usr/local/bin/ folder with the command:

    ln -s /path/to/the/prag /usr/local/bin/

  For test, typing prag in a terminal, the output should be this:

	PRAG 1.1.0
	The Console Tool for Pragwork 1.1.0
	Copyright (c) 2009-2011 Szymon Wrozynski

	Type "php prag help" for more info.


- For 'prag' command wroks on any directory, just add this line:
  
     #/usr/bin/php5
  
  on first line in 'prag' file and voila!

  For test, you can create a new project in any directory with the command:
     prag work [new_project_name]

IMPORTANT:

Make sure of did install the php5-cli library on your system.

I used these codes on Ubuntu Linux 11.04, but should works on any GNU/Linux distributions. Just knowing
the correct path for the PHP binary. ;)
